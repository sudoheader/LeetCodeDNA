Description: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 45`

### Approach 1
$O(n)$ Time Complexity
$O(1)$ Space Complexity
Explanation: Easy solution, not much to it except that it is a fibonacci-like problem. Think of `a` as being the number of ways to reach the current step and `b` as the number of ways to reach the next step. We need to loop through the number `n` while it is decrementing up to zero. Now for the hard part: to understand what is going on inside the loop, just look at the part in parenthesis `(b += a)` or `(b = b + a)`. What we are doing hear is setting our `a` equal to the number of ways to reach the next step with the number of ways to reach the current step to `b` and then at the end subtracting it with `a`. This gives us a fibonacci operation for the problem and now we can return the number of distinct ways to climb to the top `n`.
```java
class Solution {
	public int climbStairs(int n) {
		int a = 1, b = 1;
		while(n-- > 0)
			a = (b += a) - a;
		return a;
	}
}
```
